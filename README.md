# Pacman in Godot 4.3
My goal is to recreate Pacman in Godot and learn Godot in the process. In this project I used GDScript and the engine (avoiding C# and C++ as to learn something new).

# Why
I would like to create larger projects in Godot engine however most of the issues that come from a engine or language do not occur with a small game. Issues occur with larger projects such as, asset management, script management, performance, features, how to layout certain scripts to obtain certain features and so on. Pacman is an obtainable goal as a game which should allow for a finish line and a retrospective on my next project. Even **if this project is never finished it should inform the next project**.

# Method
Pacman is a big game and to get it right it does require some planning, below is my plan:

1. Create a level editor using a basic tileset
2. Use this level edtior to craft the tileset for the game
3. Create a level and aim for Pacman navigating the Maze (without moving off screen)
4. Create a system to move between screens
5. Add Ghosts with basic AI (navigates towards player)
6. Add pickups and have the level restart upon picking up all
7. Add A* Pathfinding to Ghosts
   + Add ghosts moving between screens and have the costing value mean they will actually use the shortcut
   + Also during this time differences in ghost colour behaviour will be tuned
8. Pickup to eat ghosts (and run away behaviour)
9. Scoreboard
10. Polish:
    + More valuable pickups spawn once per level
    + Lives
    + Music and Sound effects
    + Title Screen

# 1. Create a level Editor
For this I created a `DesignerTile` scene and repurposed a shader to render a single tile:
```
shader_type canvas_item;

uniform int tilesHorizontal : hint_range(1,128);
uniform int tilesVertical : hint_range(1,128);
uniform vec2 currentTile = vec2(0,0);

void fragment() 
{
	vec2 baseUV = (UV / vec2(float(tilesHorizontal),float(tilesVertical)));
	baseUV += currentTile/vec2(float(tilesHorizontal),float(tilesVertical));
	COLOR = texture(TEXTURE, baseUV);
}
```
The result allows any designer to key in the split horizontally and vertically and then get out the exact tile they require. This is not the main way to interface with `DesignerTile` there is a method '`SetTile`' which will handle this for you on an instance basis. Each `DesignerTile` can be given a position in the larger scene it will hold on to. Upon a left click it will give it's current tile and the position in the larger scene to the signal.

Taking this a step further, the `TileChooser` scene spawns 3 `DesignerTiles` and listens to the signal, "I have been clicked, you told me I was here and I look like this". For `TileChooser` it give this information to the `LevelDesigner` which updates it's current '`SelectedTile`' and this is what you paint in the main area.

After around 2 hours of setup and learning how best to put all this together, the below image shows my result.

Next I needed a grid to paint upon with the `SelectedTile`. This was technically easy but tedious as all that needed to be done was to have a grid of tiles and for those tiles to respond when I paint the tile. I started to do this starting with the top edge of the Pacman tile set.

A problem formed from this technique. The tiles I would need to create a perfect level were beginning to snowball out of control as time goes on and even at the point of getting this prototype working I was starting to run out of space.

I decided to see if anyone else had come across the tile set ballooning problem, I came across the 'Duel-Tile' solution. This involves creating a system which the data set within each tile is offset from the tile which needs to change based upon the data. Offsetting it by one (diagonally) (in this case in the negative direction) it means there are only 4 neighbours and by extension 16 possible combinations per matchup (so dirt vs grass would be 16, dirt vs water another 16 although you could re-use tiles with transparency potentially). It is best summarised in the image below and short video:

* [Draw fewer tiles - by using a Dual-Grid system! by jess::codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEWFSv3ivTg)
* [Github implementation](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot)

The first step of implementing the Duel-Tilesystem was to create a template which Jess::Codes did happen to link to within the Github and display within the video itself. Using my existing templates I created a version of the template and added a grid of tiles on top of my painter tiles. I did come across an issue at this point as even though the z-index of my clicker tiles was above the painter tiles, the ones behind were still capturing the clicks (also went down a rabbit hole of thinking it might be linked to the transparency of the image as it would occasionally work). To resolve this there are two types of tiles, those with clicks and those without - without literally set to disregard all mouse input. 

Getting the Grid aligned was tricky but eventually I managed to align things correctly. The implementation is similar to that of Jess::codes except in GDScript and using GameObjects/Scenes, in that it uses a dictionary and Enums. This allows for extra tiles to be added a momentâ€™s notice and for easy debugging. I extended the implementation a little to have a texture (defined an int in the dictionary) as there would be more than one tileset. For the prototype only one tile set was required so below is my implementation. Also, below I put a little extra time into the scaling of the tiles so now I can scale the tiles up and down without changing a bunch of numbers (now it is literally just scale I change).
